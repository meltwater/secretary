# Secretary
Secrets distribution for dynamic container environments

## TODO

* Encrypt with svc key when deploying. Test for svckey in app env by encryption configenvelope with candidate nonce and config/master keys and then string compare
* Lighter looks for a type:pem in maven when deploying and send it along in service_public_key
* Needs to declare as insecure service to get autogenerated svckey by lighter. Error if enc envvar present by no key in maven or insecure deckared
* Sign/encrypt query parameters in decrypt request to daemon (pack all of them into envelope)
* Setuid secretary-cgi that decrypts the master key to avoid 
  giving `secretary daemon` direct access to master private key.

## Examples

```
# One level encryption for writing into deployment config files
echo -n secret | ./secretary encrypt

# Two level deployment encryption for writing into runtime service config
echo -n secret | ./secretary encrypt | ./secretary encrypt --public-key=./keys/config-public-key.pem

# Decrypt one level encryption
echo <encrypted> | ./secretary decrypt

# Decrypt two level encryption
echo <encrypted> | ./secretary decrypt --private-key=./keys/config-private-key.pem | ./secretary decrypt

# Decrypt two level using daemon
./secretary daemon
echo <encrypted> | ./secretary decrypt --private-key=./keys/config-private-key.pem | ./secretary decrypt
```
